Project: Deep Learning Super Smash Brothers Melee Bot

Our project is an implementation of a deep learning AI for the video game, "Super Smash Brothers Melee". 
The goal is to create a bot for a single character in the game that learns how to play the game based off of
state information and reinforced learning. The algorithm the bot uses is Deep Q Learning.

Requirements
=========================================
Python3
Tensorflow
Tkinter
Dolphin Emulator

Installation
=========================================
To set up the bot please see UseCase1.md in the documents folder.
